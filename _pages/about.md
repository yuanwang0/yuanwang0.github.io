Hello. My name is Yuan Wang and I am a sixth year Ph.D candidate at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) expecting to defend my thesis in May 2024. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Olga Troyanskaya](https://function.princeton.edu/). We at the Troyanskaya Lab are also associated with the [Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics](https://lsi.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University and the [Flatiron Insitute Center for Computational Biology (CCB)](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-biology/) at [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/).

My research focuses on developing data-driven methods that harness the power of large-scale high-throughput sequencing data to understand the complex molecular mechanism in the context of functional genomics. During my graduate studies, I work very closely with a diverse group of scientists, with long-term collaborations across different research institutes. Together, we aim to characterize the immunological landscape of human body and develop novel diagnosis or therapeutic strategies for human diseases.
